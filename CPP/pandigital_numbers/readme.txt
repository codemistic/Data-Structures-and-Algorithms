First code is of Problem statement: https://projecteuler.net/problem=43

Idea to solve this problem is: 
we are given numbers that divides (di di+1 di+2), we will then form an array that satisifes condition and through multilple loops and by applying different fucntions like func3(), func5(), .. we will find how many values out of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} satifies that and keep oh doing it.. (Also we mark the numbers we found as 1, so that we dont get those again)
Finally we get all the numbers
