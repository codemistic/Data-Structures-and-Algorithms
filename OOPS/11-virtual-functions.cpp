// Virtual Functions
// base class can access child class functions
// RUN TIME POLYMORPHISM

// A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class.
// When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class,
// you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function.

// Virtual functions allow us to create a list of base class pointers
// and call methods of any of the derived classes without even knowing kind of derived class object.
