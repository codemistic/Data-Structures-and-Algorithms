// Feature of OOPs, that allows object to behave differently in different conditions (situations)

// Two types ->
// 1. Compile Time Polymorphism (Static) [Early binding]
// 2. Run Time Polymorphism (Dynamic) [Late binding]

/*

The word polymorphism means having many forms.
In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristics.
Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee.
So the same person posses different behavior in different situations.
This is called polymorphism.

In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

Compile time Polymorphism
Runtime Polymorphism
